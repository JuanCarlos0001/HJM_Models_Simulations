Disclaimer: This solution is showcased to share my understanding of the problem and my own approach to it. This solution is not intended for any general application.

The aim of this project is to verify the no-arbitrage condition of the Heath-Jarrow-Morton (HJM) framework, we will do this by recovering the term structure used to calibrate the model from the mean of the Monte Carlo simulations produced the model.
